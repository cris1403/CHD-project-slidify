## CHD

* We have built a risk assessment tool for estimating
a person 10-year risk of having a heart attack

* Heart disease has been the leading cause of death
worldwide

* Risk factors are variables that increase the chances of a
disease

* Key to successful prediction of CHD: identifying the most
important risk factors

## Risk factors (1)

We took into account different features:
+ demographic
+ behavioral
+ medical history
+ last blood test results

## Most dangerous risk factors

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
require(rCharts)
load("framingham.Rdata") 
framingham = na.omit(framingham)
levels(framingham$TenYearCHD)[1]='No'
levels(framingham$TenYearCHD)[2]='Yes'
levels(framingham$male)[1]='Female'
levels(framingham$male)[2]='Male'

dataset = as.data.frame(table(framingham$TenYearCHD, framingham$cholBins))
colnames(dataset)=c("CHD", "Cholesterol", "Freq")
n1 = nPlot(Freq ~ Cholesterol,  group = "CHD", data = dataset,
           type = "multiBarChart")

# fram_chd_chol = as.data.frame(table(framingham$TenYearCHD, framingham$cholBins, framingham$male))
# colnames(fram_chd_chol)=c("CHD", "Cholesterol", "Sex", "Freq")
# 
# n1 <- nPlot(Freq ~ CHD, group = "Cholesterol", data = fram_chd_chol, type = "multiBarChart")
n1$print("chart1")


# hair_eye_male <- subset(as.data.frame(HairEyeColor), Sex == "Male")
# n1 <- nPlot(Freq ~ Hair, group = "Eye", data = hair_eye_male, type = "multiBarChart")
# n1$print("chart3")

## Modeling CHD

We use logistic regression on training set to predict
whether or not a patient experienced CHD within 10
years of first examination.

The model can differentiate low-risk from high-risk
patients.
